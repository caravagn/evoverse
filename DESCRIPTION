Description: mvMOBSTER is a package that implements functions to prepare multi-sample cancer genomics data to 
  be analyzed with MOBSTER, a statistical model for tumour subclonal deconvolution which combines Dirichlet 
  mixtures with distributions predicted by theoretical population genetics. This package also interface with
  the VIBER package for variational inference of Binomial mixtures, and the CNAqc package to carry out QC of
  absolute copy number calls. This and all the other packages interoperate to make it easy to implement
  statistical analyses of cancer evolutionary dynamics.
