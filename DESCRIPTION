Description: evoverse is a package that implements functions to analyze cancer evolutionary dynamics from
  multi-sample cancer genomics data. This package allows easy access to MOBSTER, a statistical model for 
  tumour subclonal deconvolution which combines Dirichlet mixtures with distributions predicted by theoretical
  population genetics. This package also interface with the VIBER package for variational inference of 
  Binomial mixtures, and the CNAqc package to carry out QC of absolute copy number calls.
  Within the evoverse, all these packages interoperate to make it easy to implement statistical analyses of cancer 
  evolutionary dynamics.
