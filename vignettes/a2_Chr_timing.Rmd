# Pipeline overview

**Main function: ** ``pipeline_chromosome_timing`.

## Input requirements

The following data are required to run this pipeline.

* one [CNAqc](https://caravagn.github.io/CNAqc/) input dataset, which consists of: 
  * somatic mutations (with read counts data), `mutations`;
  * absolute copy number segments, `cna`;
  * tumour purity, `purity`;
  * a genome reference supported by [CNAqc](https://caravagn.github.io/CNAqc/).
  
* a list `karyotypes` of shorthands (in `Major:minor` notation) for karyotypes that should be used to perform subclonal deconvolution. 
    - By default, `c('2:0', '2:1', '2:2')` are used; 

* pipeline parameters, which allow to:
   * impose a minimum VAF on the data to analyse, `min_VAF`;
   * impose a mimumin (`min_muts`) and maximum (`N_max`) for the number of mutations to analyse;
   * identify a run by a `description`;
   * forward parameters to customise the fit(s), using an ellypsis. 
   
The input format of input data is [discussed in a CNAqc vignette.](https://caravagn.github.io/CNAqc/articles/Introduction.html).  


## Pipeline skeleton

The following steps are performed by `pipeline_chromosome_timing`.

1. input mutations are mapped to copy number segments, integrating also tumour purity using [CNAqc](https://caravagn.github.io/CNAqc/);

2. input mutations are subset according to the required input list of karyotypes; mutations that map to karyotypes with less than the required number of mutations (pipeline input), are disregarded by the analysis.

3. [MOBSTER](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster/) is used to perform deconvolution from _raw VAF data of each karyotype_; the following procedure is followed for each karyotype:

   * a first run of `mobster_fit` is performed forwarding the ellipsis parameters to the function call;
   
   * the [timing classifier](https://caravagn.github.io/evoverse/docs/articles/1_qc_models.html) of `evoverse` is used to determine a QC `"PASS"` or `"FAIL"` status for the run;
   
      * If the status is `"PASS"`, the deconvolution with this karyotype is completed. 
      * If the status is `"FAIL"`, a second run is computed using `mobster`'s default parameters; the QC is re-computed for the new run and that is considered the final result. 

4. Compute output tables:
   * one summary table  reporting the generated fits and their QC scores;
   * one assignment table with the assignements for each one of the analysed mutations.

For each [MOBSTER](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster) fit, a QC `"PASS"` or `"FAIL"` score is obtained by the [timing classifier](https://caravagn.github.io/evoverse/docs/articles/1_qc_models.html). The list of timeable karyotypes consists of all [MOBSTER](https://caravagn.github.io/mobster) fits with QC `"PASS"`.

# Example run

```{r, eval=F}
# Use example data in the CNAqc package
data(example_dataset_CNAqc, package = 'CNAqc')

pipeline = pipeline_chromosome_timing(
  mutations = CNAqc::example_dataset_CNAqc$snvs,  # Somatic mutations
  cna = CNAqc::example_dataset_CNAqc$cna,         # Copy number segments
  purity = CNAqc::example_dataset_CNAqc$purity,   # Sample purity
  reference = 'GRCh38',                           # Genome reference
  N_max = 10000,                                  # Downsample karyotypes with > 10K mutations (none here)
  min_muts = 150,                                 # Minimum number of mutations per karyotype
  min_VAF = 0.05,                                 # Minimum VAF 
  description = "Example timing dataset",         # Dataset description
  auto_setup = 'FAST'                             # Ellipsis (parameters forwarded to each mobster first run)
)
```

## Extracting output information

A special S3 output object is used to store results from this pipeline; the object implements methods for `print` and `plot`.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# S3 object
class(pipeline)

# Summary of the results
print(pipeline)
```

Fits by `mobster` are available per karyotype, as well as one table with clustering assignments and one with the summary QC results.

```{r, eval=F}
# MOBSTER fits 
print(pipeline$mobster)

# Clustering assignments
print(pipeline$table$clustering_assignments)

# Summary QC
print(pipeline$table$summary)
```

## Plots

A multi-panel figure is assembled by the S3 `plot` method, wich reports CNA segments in circular layout, and `mobster` fits with the classical green or red contour to determine the QC status of the fit.

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=6, eval=F}
plot(pipeline)
```
