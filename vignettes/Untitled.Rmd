Poisson for large $\lambda$ can be aproximated as Gaussian $(p(\lambda) = ...) \sim N(\lambda, \sqrt{\lambda})$...

Take a bin with $b$ genes, assume that in this bin we each gene is a Poisson process with rate $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the bin's segment total CNA (like CopyMix). 
\[
P_i(\lambda k) \sim N(\lambda k, \sqrt{\lambda k})
\]


The data are 
\[
x_i = \Delta_{c_{i+1} - c_i}
\]
where $c_i$ are the mean counts for the genes in bin $b_i$.  In the HMM we include the difference between the mean count from bin $b_i$ and $b_{i+1}$, so
\[
(X+Y) \sim Sk() 
\]




The genes are not independent -- because ty
