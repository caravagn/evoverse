# mvMOBSTER

mvMOBSTER (multi-variate MOBSTER) is a package to run a MOBSTER-based analysis from multi-region sequencing data of a cancer patient. 

MOBSTER is a model-based tumour subclonal deconvolution method to reconstruct the clonal architecture of a tumour. Through mvMOBSTER's
functions it is easy to analyse multiple sequencing samples per patient, going from the read counts to the output Binomial clusters. 

mvMOBSTER relies on VIBER to cluster mutant read count with variational Binomial mixtures. Wrappers to other sciClone and pyClone
are also available, together with functions to visualize data and results of the fits.
