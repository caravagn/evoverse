\title{Extract depth values as they are stored inside an \code{evoverse} dataset.}
\usage{
DP(x, ids = keys(x), samples = x$samples)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An `evoverse` object.}

\item{ids}{The id of the mutations to extract, all by default.}

\item{samples}{The samples for which we extract the data, all by default.}
}
\value{
A tibble of the required entries.
}
\description{
Extract from the internal representation of an object all the entries
that refer to the DP values. These can be subset by sample and mutation
id; by default all entries are returned. The output is a tibble; no other
transformations are executed.
}
\examples{
data('example_evoverse')

# Default is everything
DP(example_evoverse)

# Only one sample
DP(example_evoverse, samples = example_evoverse$samples[1])
}
